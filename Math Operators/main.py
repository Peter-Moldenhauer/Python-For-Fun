# Description: This program demonstrates some basic math operators in Python

# Basic Division - result is 4.5
print(18 / 4)

# Use 2 forward slashes to round down to the nearest whole number (drops the decimal place)
# result is 4
print(18 // 4)

# Use the modulus (%) to access only the remainder - result is 2
print(18 % 4)

# Calculate 5 to the 3rd power (1st way) - result is 124
print(5 * 5 * 5)

# Calculate 5 to the 3rd power (2nd way using double astriks **) - result is 125
# Same thing as 5 to the power of 3, double ** means "calculate the powers" 
print(5 ** 3)
